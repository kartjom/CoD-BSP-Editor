# Call of Duty BSP Editor
**Tool for Call of Duty 1/UO to easily edit compiled maps.**

## Introduction
Main goal of this tool is to allow anyone to easily edit **compiled BSP maps** without the need of decompiling them.\
Several actions, such as incorporating **CTF or S&D** modes, are now simplified, saving time and effort that was previously required.

## Features
- **Entity Editor**
- **Brush Collisions Editor**
- **Material Editor**
- **Vertex Editor**: Best used with my [other tool](https://github.com/kartjom/bsp-converter).
- **Integrate Gamemodes**: Easily add gamemodes such as **Capture The Flag** or **Search and Destroy** to the map.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following:

- [.NET 6 Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0) - Necessary for running the tool.
